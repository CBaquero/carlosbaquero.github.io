# Carlos Baquero

I'm an Associate Professor with Habilitation in the Informatics Department, [Universidade do Minho](http://www.uminho.pt), and a Senior Researcher at the High Assurance Laboratory (HASLab) within [INESC TEC](http://www.inestec.pt).

## Research

My research interests cover data management in eventual consistent settings, distributed data aggregation and causality tracking. In the last years I have collaborated with my co-authors in the development of data summary mechanisms such as Scalable Bloom Filters, causality tracking for dynamic settings with Interval Tree Clocks and Dotted Version Vectors and in predictable eventual consistency with Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types. My recent work has been applied in the Riak distributed database, Redis CRDBs, Akka distributed data, Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB, and is running in production systems serving millions of users worldwide.
